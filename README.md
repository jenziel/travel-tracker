# Travel Tracker
## üìù Description
Travel Tracker is app for a travel agency.  The app serves as an archive for keeping track of previous trips, as well as tracking money spent in a given year.  The app gives a user the ability to explore prices for trips they are interested in planning. 

## Context
This is my final project for Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design.  It was completed over the course of one week.

### User Interface Process: 

I referenced the Expedia.com website layout when coming up with a layout.  I liked the simplicity of the site and that the trip cards were displayed chronologically from top to bottom.  I wanted to implement the accordion menu element to reveal the trips but ran out of time.  

For the icons I used vecteezy and downloaded the images as png files. 

### Use of Web APIs:  

This project was my first chance to practice sending a POST request with multiple input fields included in the post.  
It was also my first time working with day.js and the built-in calendar elements.


## Learning Goals and Objectives
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation. 
2. Create a clear and accessible user interface. 
3. Make network requests to retrieve data. 
4. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
5. Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
